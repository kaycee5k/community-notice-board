        offers and requests for support and help. Neighbours who have needs like
        financial, shelter, medical conditions, feeding challenges and several

        also have offers to help in any way are also encouraged to do likewise.
        
        Through this platform, we support and bear each others burden.

      <p>
        our goal is to make it easier for community members to connect, share
        resources, and support one another in times of need.
